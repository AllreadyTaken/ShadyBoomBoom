# ShadyBoomBoom
## Whats this?
Its a no node npm vanilla js Fragment Shader Editor which you can run locally. it has two textures and a Time Uniform which can be utilized. I might add some more if I feel like it.
You can create a seperate Window if you want to display the shader on a beamer or another monitor. 

## Why is this?
I wanted a live shader coding tool which runs from everywhere. So in pricniple this also runs locally without internet. you would need to download the minified three.js and ace.js files and refrence them in the html.
I encourage forks. This is a template and nothing more. I didnt find here what i really needed and the solutions existing where to larger or annoying for me to setup and get to work personally, 
so i wanted something super simple instead of frankensteining somethihng out of already existing projects.
